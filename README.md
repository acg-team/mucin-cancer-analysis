# Mucin in cancer

## Overview
This project aims to explore how mucins contribute to tumor progression and microenviroment and what is the difference between primary and metastatic cancers. 

## Research Questions
The key questions guiding this project include:

- What factors affect **mucin expression** in cancer?
- Is there a correlation between **mutations in mucin genes** and their expression levels?
- Do **short tandem repeats (STRs)** occur in mucin genes, and how do they impact cancer progression?
- Can **image analysis** provide additional insights into mucin-related cancer mechanisms?
- How do mucins differ between **primary tumors and metastatic cancers**?

Additionally, we aim to classify metastatic cancer data.
